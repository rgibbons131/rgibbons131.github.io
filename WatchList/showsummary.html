                    &emsp; For the purpose of the website plan, I will create a page that exemplifies the explanations of shows. A few things that will be in each description will be a summary of the show or movie.<br>
                    &emsp; This initial description would ideally be directly copied from IMDB, as their database is quite extensive in total content, accuracy, and specificity. It would also include a few ratings from at least two sources, and then a public poll on “bingeabilty.”  <br>
                    &emsp; Also, on each show page there would need to be at least one picture from the show advertisements, maybe a trailer shot or a poster that was used to promote it. There would need to be a trailer whenever possible. The most important piece of information that I would like to include on the page is what streaming services provide access to the show or movie. This will be one of the big selling points.

                    &emsp; This show was most definitely a show and me and my not imaginary kids loved watching it because it was definitely a human show for human people. It had lots of plots and a few too many fleshy,
                    I mean rude people in the production. <br>
