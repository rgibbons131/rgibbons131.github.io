            For the purpose of the website plan, I will create a page that exemplifies the explanations of shows. A few things that will be in each description will be a summary of the show or movie.<br>
            This initial description would ideally be directly copied from IMDB, as their database is quite extensive in total content, accuracy, and specificity. It would also include a few ratings from at least two sources, and then a public poll on “bingeabilty.”  <br>
            Also, on each show page there would need to be at least one picture from the show advertisements, maybe a trailer shot or a poster that was used to promote it. There would need to be a trailer whenever possible. The most important piece of information that I would like to include on the page is what streaming services provide access to the show or movie. This will be one of the big selling points.

            This show was most definitely a show and me and my not imaginary kids loved watching it because it was definitely a human show for human people. It had lots of plots and a few too many fleshy,
            I mean rude people in the production. -Jim the "Human"
