                    <h1>Watchlist</h1>
                    <p>
                        Watchlist aims to be an easy-to-use site where you can drop in when you're bored and find a new show to watch. I want to cater to a large demographic. In totality, this idea would take connection to a large database of various shows and movies. It would be an ideal partnership to be able to partner with IMDB. <br>
                        The main page will have a few key pieces of information on it. It will explain how the information about shows is collected. Hopefully I would be able to say that the source is from IMDB, or the international movie database, showing that the information found is credible and extensive. <br>
                        There will also be a summary of bingeability as seen bellow. This will help other people understand the collective nature of the site as well as giving them understanding of this as a tool to help make their decision.<br>
                        The last major piece of information that would be advertised on the main page is that the site includes which streaming service the show or movie are currently on.
