      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How often do you want to watch a show to kill some time, but you have no idea what to watch? What about a website with a database of shows and movies from various genres? You would be able to be as specific or vague as you want. The website would generate a show for you to watch. With a simple sign in system, you would be able to keep track of all the shows you have seen too, meaning you wouldn't get repeat suggestions. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is your general college student. So many of us have time on our hands when we can't hang out with friends, we are out of youtube videos to watch, and we've just finished the show we were binging. This site will be a sleek, easy to navigate place where you can quickly go to find new shows to watch.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Watchlist aims to be an easy-to-use site where you can drop in when you're bored and find a new show to watch. I want to cater to a large demographic. In totality, this idea would take connection to a large database of various shows and movies. It would be an ideal partnership to be able to partner with IMDB. <br>
        The main page will have a few key pieces of information on it. It will explain how the information about shows is collected. Hopefully I would be able to say that the source is from IMDB, or the international movie database, showing that the information found is credible and extensive. <br>
        There will also be a summary of bingeability as seen bellow. This will help other people understand the collective nature of the site as well as giving them understanding of this as a tool to help make their decision.<br>
        The last major piece of information that would be advertised on the main page is that the site includes which streaming service the show or movie are currently on.

      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/on_phone_reading_op.jpg" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Gallery/list</h3>
      <p>
        Because it is fairly strait forward, I am going to make an extra page that is the gallery/selector of the shows. This in theory would be the main page that people would be interacting with. Here they would be able to set filters such as genre, medium, length, and even bingeabilty scores or critic ratings, but most importantly streaming services. Instead of going through each of their services individually, they'll be able to look at their whole catalogs automatically.

      </ul>
      <h3>Show summaries</h3>
      <p>
        For the purpose of the website plan, I will create a page that exemplifies the explanations of shows. A few things that will be in each description will be a summary of the show or movie.<br>
        This initial description would ideally be directly copied from IMDB, as their database is quite extensive in total content, accuracy, and specificity. It would also include a few ratings from at least two sources, and then a public poll on “bingeabilty.”  <br>
        Also, on each show page there would need to be at least one picture from the show advertisements, maybe a trailer shot or a poster that was used to promote it. There would need to be a trailer whenever possible. The most important piece of information that I would like to include on the page is what streaming services provide access to the show or movie. This will be one of the big selling points.
